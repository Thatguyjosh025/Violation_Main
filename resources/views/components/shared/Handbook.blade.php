Thus, in submitting any academic work, students are expected to properly cite references, direct quotes, and other sources including, but not limited to data obtained from the tables, illustrations, figures, pictures, images, and videos following the prescribed format of the discipline (i.e., American Psychological Association, Modern Language Association). This also applies to:</li>

                                    <li>Strive for student development by joining and actively participating in various activities sponsored by the school and recognized student organizations.

                                <p>STI is committed to providing a healthy learning environment where students support and respect each other. Thus, within the school, it is made clear that bullying will not be tolerated. "Bullying shall refer to any severe or repeated use by one (1) or more students of a written, verbal, or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to their property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other students, infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school." (Republic Act No. 10627, "Anti-Bullying Act of 2013").</p>
                                <p>Due to the advancement in technology and social media, emphasis is given on the prevention of bullying in its electronic expression: Cyberbullying. Cyberbullying shall refer to acts of cruelty committed using the internet or any form of electronic media or technology that has the effect of stripping one's dignity or causing reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm.</p>
                                <p>Strategies and mechanisms against bullying and cyberbullying (e.g., conducting anti- bullying/cyberbullying orientations to students and personnel, academic and discipline policies, guidance and counseling, information dissemination through student-teacher- parent leaflets, etc.) are meant to increase awareness and address the unacceptable nature of bullying in and around the school.</p>
                                <p>Bullying and cyberbullying behavior are confronted clearly and pursued beyond the mere application of sanctions. Students who persist in bullying/cyberbullying, despite counseling and support, are given sanctions based on this handbook. Sanctions imposed will take into account the severity of the bullying/cyberbullying incident.</p>
                            
                                <h5 class="sub-header">Anti-Hazing Law Policy</h5>
                                <p>STI is committed to ensuring a peaceful environment where camaraderie among students is fostered through various interest groups or clubs inside the campus. Every student organization is prohibited from using any form of violence, force, threat, or intimidation as a prerequisite for admission. Any STI student who is found to have committed or has conspired to commit the aforementioned shall be subject to Republic Act No. 11053, otherwise known "Anti-Hazing Act of 2018," and appropriate disciplinary action provided in this handbook.</p>

                                <p>STI is committed to creating and maintaining an environment where all members of the STI community are free to study without fear of harassment of a sexual nature. STI adheres to Republic Act 7877, otherwise known as the "Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995," which considers all forms of sexual harassment in the employment, education, or training unlawful and contrary to the dignity of every individual, as well as the latter's guarantee to respect of human rights. Given the seriousness of this matter, STI promulgates appropriate rules and regulations defining the offense of sexual harassment and outlining the procedure in the investigation and imposition of administrative sanctions in such cases.</p>
                            
                                <h5 class="sub-header">Gender and Development Policy</h5>
                                <p>STI recognizes gender sensitivity as it pertains to one's effort to show how gender shapes the role of women and men in society, including their role in the development and how their relationship affects each other. In support of the CHED Memorandum Order 01 series of 2015 entitled "Establishing the Policies and Guidelines on Gender and Development in the Commission on Higher Education and Higher Education Institutes (HEIs),"STI promotes gender awareness by appointing Gender and Development focal persons in each school to pursue and implement programs, projects, and activities that will contribute to the achievement of women's empowerment and gender equality. It shall also adopt gender mainstreaming in the academe as one of the strategies in educating and informing various sectors of society on the need to recognize and respect the rights of women and men.</p>

                                <p>To ensure that this is achieved, the following measures shall be observed:</p>

                                <p>Students who are found to be positive for drug use after the confirmatory analysis will be informed of their test results with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. The parents/ guardians of the "confirmed positive" students will be informed and required to attend a scheduled case conference.

                                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Disciplinary Measures</h4>
                                <p class="text-muted">The approach of the school to discipline has always been preventive and formative. It is not punitive but rather educative. 
                                    <br>A comprehensive and intense information campaign is initiated during the first few days of classes to ensure that all school rules and policies are communicated and understood by all concerned. 
                                    <br>A detailed warning system is in place for minor offenses. However, should all preventive measures and mechanisms fail, the school, through proper authorities, applies disciplinary measures or actions. 
                                    <br>Disciplinary measures or actions are meant to teach students the principles and ideals of justice to help them achieve self-discipline, as well as to enjoin them in developing and sustaining an atmosphere conducive to learning.</p>

                                <h5 class="sub-header">Corrective Actions to Minor and Major Offenses</h5>
                                <p>Corrective Actions are disciplinary measures that are imposed corresponding to the severity of the offense/s done by an erring student.</p>
                                
                                <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Verbal/Oral Warning</h5>
                                <p>A Verbal/Oral warning is a disciplinary measure given to a student who has committed minor violations. This is to call the attention of the student that they have not observed the appropriate behavior expected of them. It is a reminder or reprimand to a student who committed a minor offense for the first time. This shall be included on the student's record since this shall be considered an initial warning.</p>

                                <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Written Apology</h5>
                                <p>A Written Apology is a corrective action in which a student is required to write a letter of apology. This is imposed on a case-to-case basis and shall be included on the student's record.</p>

                                <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Written Reprimand</h5>
                                <p>A Written Reprimand is a corrective action that is issued by the Discipline Committee. The student is given a formal letter or notice of any violation of the school rules and regulations. The student-specific misbehavior, together with the original copy of the written reprimand form, is put on the student's record.</p>

                                <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Corrective Reinforcement</h5>
                                <p>During the period of corrective reinforcement, the student is still allowed to attend their classes. However, they have to be scheduled for one-on-one session after their last class period and to accomplish tasks as determined and given by the assigned person- in-authority of the Discipline Committee. The tasks under this sanction must help the student reflect and avoid repetition of the violated offense. The corrective reinforcement will be lifted a day after the specified date of rendering the sanction and after the completion of the task from a person-in-authority assigned by the Discipline Committee.</p>

                                <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Conference with the Discipline Committee</h5>
                                <p>The parents/guardians are called for a conference with the Discipline Committee, Program Head, and/or Guidance Counselor for them to discuss the offense and the corresponding course of action to avoid the recurrence of the offense. This is required to be done to cases with the following sanctions: Written Apology, Written Reprimand, Corrective Reinforcement, Suspension, Non-readmission, Exclusion, and Expulsion.</p>


                                <h5 class="sub-header">Categories of Disciplinary Administrative Penalties</h5>
                                <p>According to the provisions in the 2009 Manual of Regulations for Private Higher Education (MORPHE), the four (4) categories of disciplinary administrative penalties for serious offenses of school rules and regulations which may be applied to an erring student are:</p>
                                <div class="Categories">
                                    <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Suspension</h5>
                                    <p>In STI, this sanction has two (2) types:</p>
                                    <ol type="a" class="bulletin-list">
                                        <li>Suspension from class</li>
                                        <p>It is a penalty that excludes the offender from regular classwork and from other privileges or activities for a definite period of time. This is to be served within a reasonable time from the issuance of the decision of the Discipline Committee. A student under suspension is still required to report to school from 8 am to 5 pm but is not allowed to join their classes. They are required to do the task to be determined and supervised by the assigned person-in-authority of the Discipline Committee. The tasks under this sanction must help the student reflect and avoid repetition of the violated offense. Although they will be re-admitted to school, the suspension shall be put on the student's record. The suspension is imposed only after the parents or guardians have been informed through writing and invited to a conference with the Discipline Committee.</p>
                                        <li>Preventive Suspension</li>
                                        <p>A student under investigation may be preventively suspended from entering the school premises and from attending classes, when the evidence of guilt is strong and the responsible school official is morally convinced that the continued stay of the student during the period of the investigation constitutes a distraction to the normal operations of the school or poses a risk or danger to the life of persons and property in the school. The school is allowed to impose this sanction for a period not exceeding 20% of the prescribed class days for the school term. The suspension is imposed only after the parents or guardians have been informed through writing and conference with the Discipline Committee.</p>
                                    </ol>

                                    <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Non-readmission</h5>
                                    <p>Non-readmission is a penalty in which the school is allowed to deny admission or enrollment of an erring student for the school term immediately following the term when the resolution or decision finding the student guilty of the offense charged and imposing the penalty of non-readmission was promulgated. Unlike the penalty of exclusion, the student is allowed to complete the current school term when the resolution of non-readmission was promulgated. Transfer Credentials of the erring student shall be issued upon promulgation, subject to the other provisions stated in the MORPHE.</p>
                                
                                    <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Exclusion</h5>
                                    <p>Exclusion is a penalty in which the school is allowed to exclude or drop the name of the erring student from the roll of students immediately upon resolution for exclusion was promulgated. This penalty may be imposed for acts or offenses such as dishonesty, hazing, carrying deadly weapons, immorality, selling and/ or possession of prohibited drugs, drug dependency, drunkenness, hooliganism, vandalism, and other offenses analogous to the foregoing. Transfer Credentials of the erring student shall be issued upon promulgation, subject to the provisions stated in the MORPHE.</p>
                                    <p>The school shall preserve a complete record of the proceedings for a period of one (1) year in order to afford the Discipline Committee and Commission the opportunity to review the case in the event the student makes and files an appeal with the Commission on Higher Education.</p>
                                
                                    <h5 class="sub-header mt-4">Expulsion</h5>
                                    <p>Expulsion is a penalty in which an institution declares an erring student disqualified for admission to any public or private higher education institution in the Philippines.
                                        <br>In any case, the penalty of expulsion cannot be imposed without the approval of the Chairman of the Commission on Higher Education. This penalty may be imposed for acts or offenses involving moral turpitude or constituting gross misconduct, which are considered criminal pursuant to existing penal laws. 
                                        <br>The institution shall forward a complete record of the proceedings to the CHED Regional Office concerned within 10 days from the termination of the investigation of each case.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>Imposition of sanctions cited in this handbook shall not in any way prejudice the filing of cases in and the implementation of penalties prescribed by a court of law. 
                                    <br>Also, in cases that involve significant damage or destruction of property, the Discipline Committee will decide whether the recipient of the sanction will replace the destroyed, damaged, or lost property. For cases of cheating in an examination or other school activities, a failing grade shall be given in the particular examination or activity.
